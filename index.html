            <p>We aim to keep our hiring process as straightforward and transparent as possible.</p>

            <p>
                Below are the various steps of the software departments hiring process for developers.
                Things are different for non-developer yet technical positions such as User Experience expert and for
                non-technical positions such as Product Manager and Community Manager.

                        <p>In this 30-45 minute call weâ€™ll get to know each other and we'd love to hear about your motivation to applying for the position. Participating in the conversation will be an HR representative and a hiring manager or tech lead. It will be a two-way conversation and we want to
                            understand whether we'll be a good fit for one another.</p>

			<p>You will have time to introduce yourself and we will tell you about the organisation, the software development department and the team you will be working with. You will be asked about your experience and some simple technical questions. During the whole interview feel free to ask any questions.</p>

                        <h2 id="PairProgramming">Pair Programming Session</h2>
                        <p>This session will take around two hours and will be done remotely over Google Hangout. 
				One developer will be participating. There will be two main sections: 
				a straightforward programming session and a general discussion about your technical 
				preferences or experiences.</p>

		<p>
                            During the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html">pair programming</a>
			    exercise you'll be working together with one of the developers
                            on refactoring a small set of self contained legacy code. No knowledge of
                            MediaWiki or other such specific technology is required. You will have the
                            choice between doing the exercise in PHP and in JS.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            The Pair Programming allows us to see how you approach problems, how
                            you collaborate and how you communicate. You and the developer will
                            pretend to work, as colleagues, on a task at a company you just started
                            working for. This collaboration is what is evaluated, so there is no need
                            to rush and try to get as much of the exercise done as possible. If
                            it is not completed, which is likely, you will not be penalized for this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The remote pairing is done via <a href="https://floobits.com/">Floobits</a>,
                            a service that allows synchronization of code between different machines and editors.
                            If you are using one of the <a href="https://floobits.com/help/plugins">supported
                            editors</a>,
                            you can just install the Floobits plugin for it. If none of these editors works for you,
                            it is possible to use the web based editor. For the web based editor, you also set up
                            <a href="https://floobits.com/help/floomatic">synchronization of the files to your
                                device</a>,
                            since otherwise you will not be able to execute the program and tests.
                            The developer is likely to use PhpStorm (IntelliJ) as editor.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To prepare for the session, create a Floobits account and set up and test the integration
                            with your editor of choice. To do this test you can create your own Floobits workspace and
                            connect to it. Also make sure that your Google Hangout is working and that you are able
                            to execute in the language you choose for the exercise.
                        </p>
		
<p>
This will allow us to get a better understanding
                            of your technical skills and how you collaborate and communicate with people in your team. We will also be assessing how you approach problems and your thought processes as you reach a solution.

                        <p>
                            Organised at the headquarters of Wikimedia Deutschland e. V., in Berlin. It will take around three hours and is divide in four sections: 
	<ul>

<li>Interview with the Feature team (45 minutes):  you and the team will be able to ask each other questions about the organisation of the team, the processes or any other aspects which you are interested in.  This allows you to get to know your potential
                            colleagues and for them to get to know you. </li>
<li>Team Daily's Meeting (15 minutes): you'll have the chance to participate in the daily standup meeting and see what we're working on.</li>
<li>1:1 time with a developer (30 minutes): You will spend this
                            time with one of the developers you would be working with
                            by sitting next to them as they walk you through something they
                            are working on. This will give you the opportunity of getting a glimpse of the codebase, ask questions and discuss
                            things as you see fit.</li>
<li>Lunch/Coffee Break (non-compulsory, max. 1 hour): if you so wish you will have some time with 4-6 department colleagues (developers and non-developers) to meet over lunch or coffee and talk about any matters you wish in a non-working environment. Please note that this step of the process is non-compulsory. If you decide to participate Wikimedia Deutschland e. V. will take care of the coffee/lunch costs.</li>

	</ul>
                           </p> 
                        <p>
                            This day you will be given as well a tour through the office and briefly meet
                            other people from a variety of roles and teams.
                        </p>
			<p>For people living abroad we may decide to reimburse their travel costs,
                            or we choose to carry out the Insight Day remotely.

                        <p>
                            We will send you the job offer based on the details agreed upon during the
                            Insight Day.

                We try to move things along as quickly as possible, though we will likely need several days, perhaps
                up to a week in between the steps up to, and including, the Insight Day, to schedule
                sessions. You can, therefore, expect the whole process to take about 4 weeks.
