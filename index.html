            <p>
                Below are the various steps of the software departments hiring process for developers.
                Things are different for non-developer yet technical positions such as User Experience expert and for
                non-technical positions such as Product Manager and Community Manager.

                        <p>
                            This will be a 30-45 minute call with a HR representative and a hiring manager or tech-lead. Candidates will introduce themselves and will be able to hear about the organisation, the software development department. Candidates may ask questions any time during the interview. They will be asked about their experience and motivation to apply for the current position and their expectations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The aim of this step is to inform the canditate about our organisation and 
                            the team they will be working with as well as assess a bit their personality and technical skills.

                        <h2 id="PairProgramming">Pair Programming Session</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is a remote session which will take aproximately two hours. It will be organised in two parts: firstly a pure pair programming session with a tech lead followed by a conversation about a conceptual problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The aim of this step is to assess the technical competence of the candidate, how they approach problems and their thinking process towards the solution.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h2 id="InsightDay">Insight Day</h2>
                        <p>
                            This session will take place at our headquartes in Berlin and will last around three hours. It will happen as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>45 minute interview with the team the cadidate would work with</li>
                                <li>15 minute where the candidate will join the team's daily</li>
                                <li>30 minute 1:1 with one of the developers of the team where they will go over some tasks the developes is working on</li>
                                <li>(non compulsory) 1 hour Lunch/Coffee break with 2-3 developers and 2-3 other colleagues</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The aim of this session is to give the candidates and the team the opportunity to meet in a working and non-working environment. Plus the candidate will have the chance to take a peak into the daily routine of the team and ask any questions about it. 
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            This session will also allow us to see how the candidate approaches problems,
                            collaborates and communicates. The candidate and the developer will
                            pretend to work, as colleagues, on a task at a company the candidate just started
                            working for. The collaboration is what is evaluated and not the amount of work done. So please, do not rush to get the task done.
                        </p>

                        <p>Between the sections of the session candidates can take a short break if you want.</p>

                We try to move things along as quickly as possible, though likely need several days,
                up to a week, in between the steps up to, and including, the Insight Day, to schedule
                sessions. So you can expect that going though the whole process will take about 4 weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may skip the Telephone Interview for candidates already familiar to us.
